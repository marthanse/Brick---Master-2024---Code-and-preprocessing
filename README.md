# Preprocessing and analysis of hyperspectral images of brick

This repository contains the files necessary for the pre-processing of brick images. In addition, example files regarding the explorative analysis of the bricks' physical and spectral data are added.

The following files describe the pre-processing of the hyperspectral images:
- ImportImagesFunctions.py
- SaveLoadDictionaries.py
- PreprocessingFunctions.py
- - MakeBloksFunctions.py
- StreamLineFunction.py
- SNVProcessingFunctions.py
- MSCProcessingFunctions.py
- MortarRemovalFunctions


Examples regarding the use of the functions are added under the __name__=="__main__" in each files.

The code for the exploratory analysis of the brick spectra are added in:

The code for the development of the prediction models are:

Note: the files are added as examples, code which were developed and not used are excluded.
